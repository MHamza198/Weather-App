🚀 Just Built a Weather Checker Web App Using Flask! 🌤️

I'm excited to share my latest project—a weather checker web application developed using Flask and WeatherAPI. This app allows users to get real-time weather updates by entering their location. It's a simple, responsive, and informative app that I've also styled with a modern UI using Bootstrap.

💡 Key Features:
Real-time weather information 🌍
Easy-to-use interface 🔍
Responsive design with Bootstrap 🎨
Error handling to ensure smooth user experience
